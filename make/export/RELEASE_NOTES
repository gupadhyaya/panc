RELEASE NOTES FOR PANINI 0.9.0

These release notes summarizes changes in Panini 0.9.0 release.
Note that bug fixes are cumulative, that is, bug fixes in previous 
update versions are included in subsequent update versions.

** Features included in this release

* Support for capsule declarations 
	capsule C ( D d1, ... ) {
    	t s; 
        ...
        void m ( ... ) {    …   }
    } 

* Support for system declarations 
	system S1 {
		C c1; D d1; … // Declaration of capsule instances in this system
        c1 ( d1 ) ;  // Wiring capsule instances together.
	}

* Support for signature declarations
	signature S {
		void m ( ... );
	}
	capsule D implement Signature S {
	 	void m ( ... ) {
	 		...
	 	}
	}

* Support for thread-based implementation of capsules.

* Support for sequential consistency at a capsule instance-level. 
  Capsule procedure calls to a single capsule instance are processed in 
  the order in which they are made. 

* Basic support for confinement violation detection, where the Panini 
  compiler warns users about potentially leaking references to the 
  internal states of the capsule instance.
